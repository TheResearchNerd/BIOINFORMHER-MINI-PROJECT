After participating in the virtual training on;
Downloading a Biological sequence
Translating DNA sequence to Amino Acid
Finding ORFs in a DNA sequence:
Sequence composition analysis
Identifying Transcription factor binding sites
Searching for functional Motifs
Predicting coding and non-coding regions
Converting sequence file formats, with BioinformHer, I have been challenge to take a miniproject related to the training. 
You can find my report on the miniproject here.
