Finding ORFs (Open Reading Frames) in the Human TNF Gene Sequence 
Open Reading Frames (ORFs) are stretches of DNA that have the potential to code for proteins. Identifying these ORFs within a DNA sequence is crucial for indicating potential protein-coding regions. Once identified, ORFs can be translated into amino acid sequences, which can then be analyzed to predict protein structure, function, and potential interactions.
Objective: Identify the ORFs within the TNF gene sequence.
